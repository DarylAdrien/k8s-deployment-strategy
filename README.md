# k8s-deployment-strategy

This repository explores and demonstrates various deployment strategies commonly used in modern software development. Understanding these approaches is crucial for ensuring high availability, minimizing downtime, and safely introducing new features into production environments.

## Introduction

Deployment strategies define how new versions of an application are released to users. The goal is to deliver updates smoothly, reduce risks associated with new code, and maintain a positive user experience. This repository provides an overview of three prominent strategies: Rolling Updates, Canary Deployment, and Blue/Green Deployment.

## Rolling Updates

Rolling updates involve gradually replacing instances of the old version of an application with new ones. This is typically done in a phased manner, where a small number of old instances are taken down and replaced by new ones, until all instances are updated.

### How it Works:

Phased Replacement: New instances of the application (Version B) are deployed alongside existing instances (Version A).

Traffic Shifting: As new instances become healthy, traffic is gradually shifted to them.

Old Instance Decommissioning: Once a new instance is serving traffic successfully, an old instance is decommissioned.

Iteration: This process repeats until all old instances are replaced by new ones.

### Advantages:

Minimal Downtime: Users experience little to no downtime as traffic is continuously served by available instances.

Resource Efficiency: Does not require double the infrastructure, as old instances are replaced rather than running concurrently with a full new set.

Easy Rollback (to a degree): If issues arise, the rollout can be paused or rolled back by stopping the deployment and reverting to the previous version.

### Disadvantages:

Version Coexistence: For a period, both old and new versions of the application run simultaneously, which can lead to compatibility issues (e.g., database schema changes).

Slower Rollout: The gradual nature means it takes longer for the new version to be fully deployed across all instances.

Complex State Management: Managing state and ensuring data consistency between versions can be challenging.

## Canary Deployment

Canary deployment involves releasing a new version of an application to a small subset of users first. This "canary" group's experience is monitored closely for errors or performance issues before the new version is rolled out to the entire user base.

### How it Works:

Small Rollout: A new version (Version B) is deployed to a very small percentage of servers or users.

Monitoring: The performance and error rates for this "canary" group are rigorously monitored.

Evaluation: Based on the monitoring results, a decision is made:

If successful, the new version is gradually rolled out to more users.

If issues are detected, the canary deployment is rolled back, and traffic is directed entirely back to the old version (Version A).

Full Rollout: If the canary phase is successful, the new version is progressively rolled out to the remaining users, often using a rolling update mechanism.

### Advantages:

Reduced Risk: Limits the impact of potential bugs or performance regressions to a small user segment.

Real-world Testing: Allows for testing the new version with real user traffic and production data.

Early Detection: Issues can be identified and addressed before they affect a large number of users.

### Disadvantages:

Complexity: Requires robust monitoring and automated rollback capabilities.

Version Coexistence: Similar to rolling updates, both versions run concurrently, necessitating backward compatibility.

User Experience Discrepancy: The canary group might experience a different version, which could lead to inconsistent user experiences or support challenges.

## Blue/Green Deployment

Blue/Green deployment involves running two identical production environments, "Blue" and "Green." At any given time, only one environment is live and serving user traffic (e.g., "Blue"). When a new version is ready, it is deployed to the inactive environment (e.g., "Green"). Once thoroughly tested in the "Green" environment, traffic is instantly switched from "Blue" to "Green."

### How it Works:

Two Environments: Maintain two identical production environments (Blue and Green).

New Version Deployment: Deploy the new version of the application to the currently inactive environment (e.g., "Green").

Testing: Thoroughly test the new version in the "Green" environment, ensuring it functions correctly with production-like data.

Traffic Switch: Once testing is complete and successful, traffic is instantly rerouted from the "Blue" environment to the "Green" environment, making "Green" the new live environment.

Old Environment as Rollback: The "Blue" environment is kept as a hot standby for quick rollback if any issues arise with the "Green" environment. It can then be updated with the next version.

### Advantages:

Zero Downtime: The switch between environments is nearly instantaneous, resulting in virtually no downtime for users.

Instant Rollback: If issues occur, traffic can be immediately switched back to the old "Blue" environment.

Simplified Testing: The new version can be fully tested in a production-like environment before going live.

### Disadvantages:

Resource Intensive: Requires double the infrastructure resources, as two full production environments are maintained.

Database Synchronization: Managing database schema changes and data synchronization between the two environments can be complex.

Cost: The increased infrastructure can lead to higher operational costs.

## Choosing the Right Strategy

The best deployment strategy depends on several factors, including:

Application Type: Criticality, traffic volume, and tolerance for downtime.

Infrastructure: Availability of resources and automation capabilities.

Team Maturity: Experience with continuous delivery and monitoring.

Risk Tolerance: How much risk the organization is willing to take with new deployments.

Often, organizations combine elements of these strategies (e.g., using canary releases with a blue/green switch for the final rollout) to achieve optimal balance between speed, safety, and efficiency.
